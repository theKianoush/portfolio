<u>What I've been up to, as of {09/01/2025}:</u>
I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Data Science at the University of Colorado Boulder and actively seeking opportunities to build a career in the tech industry. Open to internships, research positions, and assistantships, I am eager to gain professional experience and take on stepping stones that will contribute to my long-term growth.

On the side, I am pursuing certifications such as the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and working on projects, including developing a 3D platformer video game using Unity and C++.

<u>About Me:</u>
Born and raised in Colorado Springs to a family of engineers, I was immersed in technology from an early age and always felt destined to become a productive member of the tech industry. I love tech because it’s one of the rare fields where creativity, logic, and continuous learning intersect. There’s always something new to discover—and the best part is applying what you’ve learned in your own unique, creative way.

I’ve always believed that no matter how insurmountable an obstacle may seem, it can be overcome with perseverance.

<u>My Journey with Linux:</u>
This website is a testament to my love for Linux, which blossomed during my undergraduate studies at the University of Colorado Denver, where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 

I was first introduced to Linux and programming as a freshman in a robotics class, where my team and I collaboratively coded Arduino and Raspberry Pi systems to control a car-like robot. Over the course of my studies, I had the opportunity to utilize Linux in various ways—developing web applications with both the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) and the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)—while adding new tools to my arsenal like Git. 

I've worked with a variety of Linux distributions using VMware, which gave me hands-on experience across different systems. I came to appreciate Raspberry Pi OS for its simplicity and ease of use, while also developing an affinity for Kali Linux due to its powerful networking tools (Wireshark, Nmap), cybersecurity utilities (Nessus), and anonymity features (Tor, proxychains).

After compiling and running countless C++ files while building a local computer network, I came to the conclusion that C++ is my favorite programming language. I found it easier to use compared to Python, especially when it came to object-oriented programming.

I love tech, from the hardware of a computer, to the entire system of computer networks and how it operates. How an electrical pulse, this tiny signal can travel through complex computer networks all the way across the other side of the globe in almost an instant. The fact that we can pack and conceal information within electrical signals, the fact that when you break this information down on a base level it is nothing but a combination of 1s and 0s.
