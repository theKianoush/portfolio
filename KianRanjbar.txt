<u>My Journey with Linux:</u>
This website is a testament to my love for Linux, which blossomed during my undergraduate studies at the University of Colorado Denver, where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 

I was first introduced to Linux and programming as a freshman in a robotics class, where my team and I collaboratively coded Arduino and Raspberry Pi systems to control a car-like robot. Over the course of my studies, I had the opportunity to utilize Linux in various ways—developing web applications with both the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) and the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)—while adding new tools to my arsenal like Git. 

I've worked with a variety of Linux distributions using VMware, which gave me hands-on experience across different systems. I came to appreciate Raspberry Pi OS for its simplicity and ease of use, while also developing an affinity for Kali Linux due to its powerful networking tools (Wireshark, Nmap), cybersecurity utilities (Nessus), and anonymity features (Tor, proxychains).

After compiling and running countless C++ files while building a local computer network, I came to the conclusion that C++ is my favorite programming language. I found it easier to use compared to Python, as it allows you to understand code on a more fundamental level (kind of like driving stick-shift as opposed to automatic).
