<u>What I've been up to, as of {11/11/2025}:</u>
Ive been up to a lot as of late, I am actively:
- Pursuing a Master’s degree in Data Science @ the University of Colorado Boulder
- In a Web Development fellowship @ Dream Tank
- In a Data Analysis externship @ Extern - “Outamation: Advanced AI-Powered Document Insights and Data Extraction”
- Studying for certifications, like: CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate), and AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner
- Working on projects, like: Where's Waldo? Computer Vision (object-detection) program, and a personal Ai knowledge assistant, where you can ask questions about yourself 
- Applying for jobs, looking to land a technical position to utilize my skills

<u>About Me:</u>
Dedicated and determined to break into the tech industry. I am excited to learn from professionals, build experience and connections, and apply the skills I’ve worked hard to develop, while making money doing what I love. I aim to exemplify exceptionalism and professionalism, through my punctuality, work ethic, and resolutely positive demeanor. 

I have heard it all - the economy is in a recession, the job market is brutal, unemployment is at an all time high, AI is replacing jobs in your industry, what do they need you for? And my answer is, I have something a computer doesn’t - a heart. It drives me to <span id="k">Never Give Up</span>, <!-- sjkfhskjf -->I won’t stop until I am a successful professional despite any momentous adversities.

<u>My Journey with Linux:</u>
This website is a testament to my love for Linux, which blossomed during my undergraduate studies at the University of Colorado Denver, where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 

I was first introduced to Linux and programming as a freshman in a robotics class, where my team and I collaboratively coded Arduino and Raspberry Pi systems to control a car-like robot. Over the course of my studies, I had the opportunity to utilize Linux in various ways—developing web applications with both the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) and the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)—while adding new tools to my arsenal like Git. 

I've worked with a variety of Linux distributions using VMware, which gave me hands-on experience across different systems. I came to appreciate Raspberry Pi OS for its simplicity and ease of use, while also developing an affinity for Kali Linux due to its powerful networking tools (Wireshark, Nmap), cybersecurity utilities (Nessus), and anonymity features (Tor, proxychains).

After compiling and running countless C++ files while building a local computer network, I came to the conclusion that C++ is my favorite programming language. I found it easier to use compared to Python, as it allows you to understand code on a more fundamental level (kind of like driving stick-shift as opposed to automatic).
