Hello World! My name is Kian Ranjbar.
Welcome to my simple Linux inspired website!

<u>What I've been up to, as of {6/3/2025}:</u>
Currently training with Coursera, completing courses in preparation for the CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) certification. Also working on passion projects, including developing a 3D platformer video game using Unity and C++, and building a personal blog to share with family and friends.

<u>About Me:</u>
Born and raised in Colorado Springs to a family of engineers, I was immersed in technology from an early age and always felt destined to become a productive member of the tech industry. I love tech because it’s one of the rare fields where creativity, logic, and continuous learning intersect. There’s always something new to discover—and the best part is applying what you’ve learned in your own unique, creative way.

Outside of tech, my favorite hobbies are mixed martial arts and chess. I’m drawn to both because they challenge you to overcome obstacles using a combination of training, and creativity—just like programming. Bruce Lee once described martial arts as “honestly expressing yourself,” and that’s exactly how I feel when I’m coding or playing chess. Whether it’s building an application, strategizing in a match, or sparring in the gym, I see each of these as a way to express who I am through action and precision.

I’ve always believed that no matter how insurmountable something may seem, it can be overcome with persistence. Persistence is key, and perseverance is what separates winners from losers. "<span id="k">Never give up!</span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->

<u>My Journey with Linux:</u>
This website is a testament to my love for Linux, which blossomed during my undergraduate studies at the University of Colorado Denver, where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 

I was first introduced to Linux and programming as a freshman in a robotics class, where my team and I collaboratively coded Arduino and Raspberry Pi systems to control a car-like robot. Over the course of my studies, I had the opportunity to utilize Linux in various ways—developing web applications with both the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) and the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)—while adding new tools to my arsenal like Git. 

I've worked with a variety of Linux distributions using VMware, which gave me hands-on experience across different systems. I came to appreciate Raspberry Pi OS for its simplicity and ease of use, while also developing an affinity for Kali Linux due to its powerful networking tools (Wireshark, Nmap), cybersecurity utilities (Nessus), and anonymity features (Tor, proxychains).

After compiling and running countless C++ files while building a local computer network, I came to the conclusion that C++ is my favorite programming language. I found it easier to use compared to Python, especially when it came to object-oriented programming.

I love cybersecurity, computer networks, programming in C++ and Python, Linux (of course), and all things tech.

<hr>
I’m eager to bring my passion, discipline, and work ethic into the tech industry—ready to learn, contribute, and make a meaningful impact from day one.
